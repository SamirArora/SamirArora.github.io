I am a first-year PhD student in Statistics at Simon Fraser University. My research focuses on developing novel Monte Carlo methods, including extensions of Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) and Sequential Monte Carlo (SMC), as well as applying them to problems in statistical machine learning. My goal is to design computational tools that improve uncertainty quantification, model selection, and the reliability of complex models such as neural networks. My research supervisor is [Dr. Liangliang Wang](https://www.sfu.ca/~lwa68/).
