### about me
 - PhD student in Statistics at Simon Fraser University.
 - Research focus: Monte Carlo methods, particularly Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) and Sequential Monte Carlo (SMC) and statistical machine learning.
 - Interests: Developing new Monte Carlo methods and applying them to problems in statistical machine learning. My goal is to design computational tools that improve uncertainty quantification, model selection, and the reliability of complex models such as neural networks.
 - Supervisor: [Dr. Liangliang Wang](https://www.sfu.ca/~lwa68/).

Annealed Sequential Monte Carlo (ASMC).<br>
A sampling method where a sequence of intermediate distributions smoothly interpolates from a tractable initial distribution to a complex target distribution, enabling efficient estimation and sampling. In much the same way, complex challenges in life can often be tackled more effectively by breaking them down into smaller, manageable tasks.
